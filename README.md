## ðŸš€ Features

- **Advanced Models**: Dive deep into cutting-edge architectures and methodologies.
- **Thorough Experiments**: Gain insights into how different models behave under diverse scenarios.
- **Utilities**: Make use of handy functions and tools to make your workflow smoother.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

For the experiments and models housed in this repository, please refer to the dataset here:
[Google Drive Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H_m-z_42hEdGmaGl_70ZPtECSGU-r2M9?usp=sharing)

Ensure to download and position the dataset correctly before executing the experiments.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/variyas31/a2DL.git
   ```

### 2. **Procure the Dataset**

   - Access the [Google Drive Dataset Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H_m-z_42hEdGmaGl_70ZPtECSGU-r2M9?usp=sharing) to fetch the dataset.
   - Extract and situate the dataset in the `data/` directory (or as indicated in the code).

### 3. **Environment Setup and Installation**

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Python (version 3.6 or newer recommended).
- Jupyter Notebook is essential.

#### Steps:

   i. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but advised)

      This step helps in evading any potential conflicts with other projects or global packages:

      ```bash
      python -m venv a2DL_env
      source a2DL_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `a2DL_env\Scripts\activate`
      ```

   ii. **Install Necessary Libraries**

      ```bash
      pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn tensorflow Pillow numpy scikit-learn keras-tuner jupyter IPython
      ```

   iii. **Kickstart Jupyter Notebook**

      ```bash
      jupyter notebook
      ```

      This command opens the Jupyter interface in your default browser. From there, navigate to the `a2DL` repository's location and open the relevant notebooks.
